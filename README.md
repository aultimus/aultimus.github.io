## DEPRECATION WARNING

As of December 2025, this repo is deprecated in favour of github.com/aultimus/foobarcat-homepage which now also includes blog posts for styling and layout consistency.

## Development

https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

To run dev server for previewing before pushing:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Temporary HTML files will be generated in `_site` directory, this is what will be served.

## Posting

Add new files in _posts. Push to main to publish

## TODO

I liked the minima layout but not the colours - try and get a dark theme going which also has a nice layout
